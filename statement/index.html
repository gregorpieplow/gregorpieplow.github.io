    <h1> STATEMENT </h1>

    <br>
    <p> 
    Over the years I have come to see my drawings as a kind of exploration: the slow revealing of a world as yet unseen. 
    Much like the real world, exploring these worlds has its challenges. No map exists for this terrain and I do not know what I will encounter. 
    I must commit to a shape knowing that it will take hours and hours to complete. Since I rarely pre-sketch or plan with pencil, every line I lay down is final.
    A set of axioms provides some guidelines for my explorations, for example: No line may cross another by accident; Almost every line needs a partner.
    This set, however, is not fixed and discovering new axioms, as well as sylistic elements within them, expands my pallate. 
    The style of my work is defined by my discoveries: elements from various images may reappear or evolve. 
    <br>

    Even though I have been developing this style since my childhood, it has not been suspended in a vacuum. I am influenced by themes 
    explored by M.C. Escher but my inspiration also comes from non-visual sources: The Polish science fiction author Stanislaw Lem inspired 
    the Solaris drawing. Often if someone asks me what a particular drawing means I muster up a response
    somewhat in line with one of the central themes of the book: Humans are curious, they describe and analyze, but they should be aware that, after
    all, we do not know if nature cares about meanings. At some point during the process of completing a larger project, I love to listen to Sun Ra or Charles Mingus - 
    Sun Ra's music in particular comes the closest to recreating in sound what I hear when I listen to my drawings.

    My currently projects involve larger formats, allowing for exploration of more expansive worlds. I am also continuing to pursue the discovery of new textures and 
    elements that work in the context of my previous work.
